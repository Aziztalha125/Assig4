    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were first identified in the 1960s in the noses of patients with the common cold. Two human coronaviruses are responsible for a large proportion of common colds OC43 and 229E.
Coronaviruses were given their name based on the crown-like projections on their surfaces. “Corona” in Latin means “halo” or “crown.”
Among humans, infection most often occurs during the winter months as well as early spring. </p>
    <p class="text_column">More than 1,000 people have contracted the virus in China. Health authorities have identified several other people with 2019-nCov around the world, including multiple individuals in the United States. On January 31, 2020, the virus passed from one person to another in the U.S. The World Health Organization (WHO) have declared a public health emergency relating to 2019-nCov. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Since then, 2019-nCov has started causing disruption in 24 other countries. In the United Kingdom on February 10, 2020, a clinic in Brighton closed temporarily after a member of staff contracted the virus. At the time of writing, they are one of eight people with the virus</p>

    <p class="parallax_description">it's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is or how it spreads. It appears to be spreading from person to person among those in close contact. It may be spread by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes.

It's not known if a person can catch the virus by touching a surface that an infected person has touched, and then putting his or her hand to the mouth.</p>
